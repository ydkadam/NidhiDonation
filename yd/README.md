Deployed a payment gateway integrated website on Azure Services. There is a donation button on homepage. On clicking the donate button, the user will land on the payment page where user can select the amount to be paid and the payment type, e.g. credit card, Paypal, etc. Once the payment is done and invoice will be generated and email will be sent to the user for the payment received. The invoice will contain the amount. My website name is Nidhi Foundation and it's for the donation for the help of needy people, trees, against pollution, etc. 


Technology used :
i have Azure Storage, Azure Blob, Azure Static website, azure bot service, Azure Cost Management and Billing and Visual Studio Code. I have hosted it on Microsoft Azure. I have added a donate button and added donate option from RAZORPAY. i have used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.   


I have used containers in the code and the code is really easy to understand and user-friendly.


I have deployed it in Azure from storage accounts and created a resource group and in Static Websites, we have to add our index and error HTML file. I will get a path address where my website will get uploaded. In Blob inventory I uploaded all my .HTML, .CSS files.i'll use azure sandbox to create my project .because of the time limit given to the sandbox my demo website will not shows the website  after some time that's why i put screenshot to down.



This is how my website look like
